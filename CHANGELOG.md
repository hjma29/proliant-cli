## v1.0.13 — 2026-07-02

### Bug Fixes
- `proliant com login --password`: the password prompt now masks input — every character you type **or paste** shows a matching `*`. Previously nothing appeared as you typed, making the prompt look frozen.
- `proliant com workspaces`: listing workspaces now works right after an OAuth/email login instead of failing with "requires a user OAuth token session".

### Enhancements
- `proliant com login`: when your account has only one workspace, the CLI now logs in directly and tells you which workspace it selected instead of showing a single-item picker.

## v1.0.12 — 2026-07-02

### Enhancements
- Windows now installs via a signed GUI installer (`proliant-cli-windows-setup.exe`) into `C:\Program Files\proliant-cli`, with an Add/Remove Programs entry and machine PATH setup. This replaces the single self-extracting `.exe`, which some endpoint security tools (Defender, CrowdStrike Falcon) flagged.
- `proliant update` on Windows now downloads and runs the installer instead of swapping the running binary in place.

### Bug Fixes
- `proliant oneview`: missing config now shows a clean "run init" message instead of a raw Python traceback, and reads inventory from the same `~/.config/proliant-cli` location as the other commands.

## v1.0.11 — 2026-07-01

### New Features
- `proliant oneview enclosures describe`: show GUI-like enclosure bay layout and hardware detail tables.
- `proliant oneview server-profiles describe`: show detailed profile, firmware, connection, boot, BIOS, and address settings.
- `proliant oneview mac describe`: trace a MAC with a diagram focused on the learned endpoint or uplink.

### Bug Fixes
- PowerShell completion now handles namespace delegation, trailing spaces, and values containing spaces or commas more reliably.
- Sentry telemetry now drops expected user/environment errors such as authentication failures, timeouts, missing config, and invalid input.
- OneView requests now report connection and timeout failures as clean CLI errors.

### Enhancements
- OneView MAC list output hides server profile columns when entries are not related to a server profile.
- OneView `--json` can be used before or after subcommand arguments.
- OneView output uses cleaner status coloring, compact server names, and richer network, enclosure, and profile details.

## v1.0.9 — 2026-06-26

### New Features
- `proliant setting telemetry on|off`: enable or disable Sentry error telemetry via marker files.
- `proliant setting uninstall`: remove all proliant-cli config and cache directories.
- `proliant ilo init` now creates `inventory.ini` in `~/.config/proliant-cli/` instead of the current directory.

### Enhancements
- Renamed `proliant config` subcommand to `proliant setting`.
- Standardised config and cache directories to `~/.config/proliant-cli/` and `~/.cache/proliant-cli/` across all platforms.
- SPP and QuickSpecs caches now stored under `~/.cache/proliant-cli/spp/` and `~/.cache/proliant-cli/qs/`.
- Telemetry now controlled by marker files (`telemetry-enabled`/`telemetry-disabled`) in addition to `PROLIANT_TELEMETRY` env var.

## v1.0.8 — 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes

---

## v1.0.7 — 2026-06-25

### Bug Fixes

---

## v1.0.6

### New Features
